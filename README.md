# What's in this repository

This repository is an implementation of the singly linked list data structure, including creating, appending, inserting, deleting, counting, reversing, query, traversal and destroying manipulations.

On Windows, what we need to do is put these files in a Visual Studio project and build them, after which we can run the main routine with either the debug or the release version executable file.

On linux, just compile it with a gcc command line like this:

```bash
gcc -o main main.c list.c
./main
```

You may also reuse the singly linked list functions in this repository by simply including the "list.h" file somewhere else.
